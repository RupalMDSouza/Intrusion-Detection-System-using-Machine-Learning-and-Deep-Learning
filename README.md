# Intrusion-Detection-System-using-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning

The exponential growth in internet usage has led to a surge in cyber-attacks, with Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks being among the most significant threats. A DDoS attack inundates a target device with excessive unwanted messages, causing severe congestion and disrupting normal operations. This project focuses on developing an AI-driven Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to identify and mitigate such attacks within communication networks.

The core objective of the project is to create a robust IDS leveraging machine learning techniques to detect DDoS attacks effectively. The system is trained and tested using the CIC-DDoS 2019 dataset, a comprehensive resource for understanding modern DDoS attack patterns.

#Key Features:

  Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  Logistic Regression (LR)
  Random Forest (RF)
  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Evaluation Metrics:
  Accuracy
  Precision
  F1-Score
  Recall

Feature Selection:
Performance is analyzed with and without feature selection to assess its impact.

Comparative Analysis:
The machine learning models are benchmarked against deep learning approaches such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

Results:
Among the machine learning models tested, Random Forest demonstrated the highest accuracy, outperforming other approaches in detecting DDoS attacks.

This project provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating the efficacy of various machine learning and deep learning techniques in intrusion detection, offering a scalable solution to bolster network security against DDoS attacks.
